Peel and thinly slice the onion. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Peel and medium dice the carrots. Roughly chop the capers. Remove and discard the stems of the collard greens; roughly chop the leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(238, 96, 85);\">Step 3:</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>While the lentils continue to cook, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt, pepper, and half the spice blend. In a large pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(238, 96, 85);\">Step 4:</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Add the sliced onion, chopped garlic, and diced carrots to pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. (If the pan seems dry, add 2 teaspoons of olive oil.) Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. Add the tomato paste, chopped capers, remaining spice blend, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until dark red and fragrant. Add the chopped collard greens and 2 cups of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any fond, 8 to 9 minutes, or until the collard greens have wilted and the liquid has thickened. Turn off the heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(238, 96, 85);\">Step 5:</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Slice the cooked chicken crosswise. Add the cooked lentils and vinegar to the pan of cooked vegetables. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the finished lentils and vegetables topped with the sliced chicken. Garnish with the cheese. Enjoy!</p>', '/dist/images/img_tuscan-chicken-green-lentil-stew.jpg');
